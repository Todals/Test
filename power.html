 <p class="ptextl">In this assignment we got to work in groups of 4 in an agile workflow. We used the scrum method to create a prototype for an
 online website for a power company.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextl">We did this by gathering intel on an agile workflow, actually performing the scrum method with sprint planning, daily standups,
 a new scrum master every sprint, a sprint review after each sprint and held a sprint demo for the class after sprint 1,2 and 5.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextl">We also made functioning wireframes and protoypes in figma.</p>

<!-- section for sprint 1 -->
<section class="sprint1s">
 <h5 class="sprintl"> SPRINT 1 </h5>
 <p class="ptextl"> In our first sprint we learned how to work with scrum, we researched about this method of agile workflow and started impelenting it. A scrum master was chosen and a trello board was created to keep track of out tasks. </p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextl"> After that we reviewed a competing power companies website with a few tasks to see how easy or difficult they were to perform and scored them from 1-5. WE then rephrased the tasks into user stories. This was done so that we could build a prototype that solved the potential problems and made the usability even better than the websites already on the market.</p>

 <h5 class="sprintr"> SPRINT 2 </h5>
 <aside  class="aside1"><img class="imgc3" src="elbolag1.png" alt="two white squares with very basic outline wireframes of a power company website"></aside>
 <p class="ptextr"> In sprint 2 we got to choose a new scrum master, this happened every sprint so all four of us got to try it out.
 We prioritized our user stories, time estimate them in the trello board to make sure we stayed within the timeframe and started creating our wireframes in black and white.
 My assigned wireframes were the landing page and the “about us” page. At this stage we were instructed to not use images and example-text so that we could focus on the basics. </p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextr"> We kept track of our assigned cards in trello by moving them accordingly from the backlog to “doing” and lastly “done”.
 Since everyone moved their own cards, the whole team knew how much work was left and the scrum master could make sure each member was doing what they were supposed to.</p>
</section>

<!-- section for sprint 3 -->
<section class="sprint3s">
 <h5 class="sprintl"> SPRINT 3 </h5>
 <p class="ptextl"> In sprint 3 we stepped up the game with 11 new user stories with acceptance criteria assigned by
 the product owner and also a few ones that we had to reformulate as a team. In sprint 3,4 and 5 we were going to create
 new black and white wireframes for the new corresponding userstories, all wireframes were required to be designed
 for both desktop and mobile. </p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextl"> In this sprint we also implemented a “definition of done” to make sure
 all the wireframes met our quality standard. </p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextl"> We choose to start with the desktop versions in this sprint because we
 felt it was easier to implement the mobile version when we had the
 bigger desktop versions done.</p>

 <aside class="aside1"><img class="imgc2" src="kanelmockup.png" alt="a mockup of a welcome email for a new customer for a power company on a samsung phone"></aside>
 <p class="ptextr"> In the fourth sprint we were assigned some new tasks. The texts in our wireframes now needed to be changed
 from example text to real information so that the wireframes looked more and more like a real product.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextr"> At this stage we were done with the desktop versions and moved on to the mobile versions.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextr"> When we were done with the mobile wireframes we moved on to user testing. Each member of the team tested
 3 people and wrote down the user feedback. This was done so that we could get usability feedback. It’s one thing to
 understand your own design. but when someone from outside the team uses the wireframe, you really get to see the flaws in your design. </p>
 <br>
</section>

<!-- section for sprint 5 -->
<section class="sprint3s">
 <h5 class="sprintl"> SPRINT 5 </h5>
 <p class="ptextl"> In the final sprint we were instructed to transform the wireframes with the design system we were provided by the product owner to make it
 look alive. This included fonts, color, buttons and image styles. </p>
 <br>
 <p class="ptextl">We chose the colors that fit our team. A minimalistic and clean looking design with an easy to navigate interface. That way it’s easier for the user
 to see the main features and how to use it. </p>

 <h6> AND AFTER 5 WEEKS OF HARD WORK AND DEDICATION, OUR PROTOTYPE WAS DONE.</h6>

 <p> Unfortunately I don’t have any images of the prototype since the owner of the figma project deleted it. </p>

<!--final section with summary lists -->
<section class="lessons">
 <h3>KEY INSIGHTS</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>The importance of teamwork and that all members of the team need to contribute for it to work smoothly.</li>
  <li>That working with the same team for a long time has alot of benifits, you get to know each others strengths
  and weaknesses. That way you can work with or around them and not against them.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>LESSONS LEARNED:</h4>
 <ol>
   <li>Save</li>
   <li>Save</li>
   <li>Save</li>
   <li>Always backup save in case something goes wrong.</li>
